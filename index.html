            <h1>Candi Prambanan</h1>
            <img class="img-popup" src="image/prambanan.svg" alt="">
            <p>Built on the ninth Century, Prambanan Temple is the largest Hindu temple complex in Indonesia. The first
                mention of Prambanan was in the Syiwagrha Inscription (856AD). With three main temples for the Trimurti;
                Shiva the destroyer of the universe, Vishnu the keeper of the universe, and Brahma the creator of the
                universe. Back in the glory days of the old Mataram Kingdom, Prambanan is used as a Candi Agung for
                various royal and religious ceremonies.

                The high structures are typical of Hindu architecture, and the plan of the temple complex is a Mandala,
                as is Borobudur. As a symbol of the Hindu cosmos, the temple is vertically divided into three parts,
                both vertically and in plan. The three part is divided into Jaba/Bhurloka, Tengahan/Bhuvarloka, and
                Njeron/Svarloka.

                At the Garbagriha (innermost sanctum) of this temple sits a three meters statue of Shiva. Prambanan as a
                Hindu Temple was made High and slim compared to Borobudur, with the main Shiva shrine stands 47 meters
                in the middle of the complex surrounded with smaller temples. Prambanan has a bas-relief on the inner
                side of the gate around the three main shrine. The bas-relief tells the story about Ramayana and can be
                read from the east gate clockwise around the inner compound.

            <img class="img-popup" src="image/borobudur.svg" alt="">
            <p>The Sailendra dynasty built this Largest Buddhist monument in the world between AD 780 and 840. The
                Sailendra are the ruling dynasty in Central Java at the time. It was built as a place for glorifying
                Buddha and a pilgrimage spot to guide mankind from worldly desires into enlightenment and wisdom
                according to Buddha. This monument was discovered by the British in 1814 under Sir Thomas Stanford
                Raffles, it was until 1835 that the entire area of the temple has been cleared.

                Borobudur built in the style of Mandala which symbolizes the universe in Buddhist teaching. This
                structure is square shaped with four entry point and a circular center point. Working from the exterior
                to the interior, three zones of consciousness are represented, with the central sphere representing
                unconsciousness or Nirvana.
